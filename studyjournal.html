<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>A Personal Study Guide is a space for you to document your learning throughout the course actively. It is not an assignment, and it is not graded. Its purpose is to help you think, practice, and connect ideas over time in ways that work for you.</p>
<p>You will keep your study guide inside your course GitHub repository, so it evolves alongside your code, projects, and labs. Think of this as a developer’s learning notebook, not a set of polished notes.</p>
<h2>What This Is (and Is Not)</h2>
<h3>This is</h3>
<ul>
<li>A personal learning resource you build for yourself</li>
<li>A place to record understanding, confusion, examples, and patterns</li>
<li>Flexible in format and content</li>
<li>Something you can return to when preparing for exams, projects, or interviews</li>
</ul>
<h3>This is not</h3>
<ul>
<li>A required or graded deliverable</li>
<li>Something meant to be perfect, complete, or public-facing</li>
<li>A copy of the textbook, slides, or someone else’s notes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Where It Lives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your study guide should live in your course GitHub repository.</li>
<li>A study-guide or journal folder in the repository</li>
<li>A NOTES.md or STUDY.md file, or other documents or recordings</li>
<li>Multiple markdown files organized by topic or week</li>
<li>You may use any structure that makes sense to you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What You Can Include</h2>
<p>Your study guide can take many forms. Writing is common, but not required. You may mix formats freely.</p>
<h3>Written Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Explanations in your own words</li>
<li>Short summaries of concepts</li>
<li>“Here is what finally made this click for me”</li>
<li>Lists of common mistakes or pitfalls</li>
</ul>
<h3>Code and Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>Small, focused code examples</li>
<li>Variations of examples discussed in class</li>
<li>“What happens if I change this?” experiments</li>
<li>Annotated snippets explaining why something works</li>
</ul>
<h3>Diagrams and Images</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hand-drawn diagrams (scanned or photographed)</li>
<li>Architecture sketches</li>
<li>Flowcharts or schema diagrams</li>
<li>Screenshots with notes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recordings</h3>
<ul>
<li>Short audio or video explanations to yourself</li>
<li>Walkthroughs of a concept or solution</li>
<li>Screen recordings showing code behavior</li>
</ul>
<h3>Questions and Reflections</h3>
<ul>
<li>Questions you still have</li>
<li>Things you struggled with and how you resolved them</li>
<li>Connections between topics</li>
<li>Notes on feedback you received</li>
</ul>
<h2>Course-Specific Suggestions</h2>

<p>You are encouraged to tailor your study guide to the course.</p>
<h3>Java Programming</h3>
<p>You might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notes with page numbers referring to the books</li>
<li>Class and object diagrams</li>
<li>Examples showing features</li>
<li>Notes on the subtleties of Java semantics</li>
<li>Explanations of common errors and exceptions</li>
<li>Comparisons between similar constructs</li>
<li>Short programs that isolate one concept</li>
</ul>
<h3>Web Page Programming</h3>
<p>You might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notes from reading the material</li>
<li>HTML structure patterns, tags, features.</li>
<li>CSS layout diagrams and experiments</li>
<li>JavaScript behavior walkthroughs</li>
<li>DOM manipulation examples</li>
<li>Notes on browser behavior or debugging techniques</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advanced Database Course</h3>
<p>You might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notes with page numbers referring to the books</li>
<li>Schema designs and ER diagrams</li>
<li>Normalization examples and tradeoffs</li>
<li>Query patterns with explanations</li>
<li>Execution plan observations</li>
<li>Reflections on performance, indexing, or design decisions</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Detailed Should It Be?</h2>
<p>As detailed as you need it. Some students write a few bullet points per topic. Others build extensive explanations with examples. Both are valid. The goal is usefulness, not volume. If you can come back later and say, “This helps me understand or remember,” then it is doing its job.</p>
<h2>A Final Note</h2>
<p>Because this study guide is optional and ungraded, you are free to experiment. If something does not work for you, change it. If a format helps you learn better, lean into it. Professional developers constantly build personal notes, scratch files, and learning artifacts. This is practice for that habit.</p>
