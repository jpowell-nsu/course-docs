<p>I want to help you succeed, but many assignment questions cannot be answered accurately or efficiently by email. To help you effectively, I need to see what you see, understand what you have done, and hear how you are thinking about the problem. Explaining complex issues entirely through email also takes significant time for both of us. For these reasons, email is often not the best way to receive help with assignments.</p>
<p>Please plan to visit during office hours, either in person or virtually. Virtual meetings through Teams allow us to share screens, review your work together, and discuss changes in real time. This approach has been very practical for many students and is often the fastest way to resolve questions.</p>
<p>If you cannot attend regular office hours, you may request an appointment outside of those times.</p>
<p>You do not need to notify me in advance if you plan to attend office hours. Appointments do require advance notice. If you would like, you may send materials in advance, but they must include all relevant files and a brief description of what you would like to discuss.</p>
<p>When asking for help, you should include supporting material that shows what you have already done or what you are thinking. This demonstrates that you have completed the necessary preliminary work and are prepared for a productive discussion. It also helps reduce the time needed to identify the issue.</p>
<p>Be prepared to explain your work. I will usually begin by asking you to walk me through what you have done. You should use appropriate terminology, explain your steps, identify where the problem begins, and describe what you believe may be causing it.</p>
<p>Please understand that not all problems can be solved in a short meeting.</p>
<p>Do not expect me to fix the work for you. My role is to help you understand the issue, guide you in the right direction, and point you to resources that will help you improve. If I ask you to review course materials or other resources, that is part of the learning process and is intended to help you succeed.</p>
<p>Finally, do not wait until the last minute to seek help. My availability is outlined in the syllabus. Assignments are due on weekends to give you additional time to complete them, not because your instructor is monitoring email throughout the weekend.</p>
