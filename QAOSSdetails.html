<h2 style="text-align: center;">Additional Policy Details</h2>
<p>This course applies selected principles from open source software development to support learning, fairness, and professional preparation. These principles include visibility of work, exposure to multiple solutions, constructive comparison of approaches, and accountability for individual contributions.</p>
<h2>Personal Review Component</h2>
<p>Selected assignments may include a personal review component. The purpose of this review is to ensure students understand and can explain their own work.</p>
<p>If selected, students may be asked to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walk through how their solution works</li>
<li>Explain design decisions, structure, and features used</li>
<li>Discuss underlying concepts and problem-solving strategies</li>
<li>Address questions or issues identified during grading</li>
</ul>
<p>Personal reviews may occur randomly, due to instructional interest, or when additional clarification of a submission would be beneficial.</p>

<h2>Shared Repository Component</h2>
<p>After grading is complete, the instructor may place any assignment submissions into a Git repository accessible to all students enrolled in any section of this course. The repository will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be accessible only to students enrolled in the course</li>
<li>Exclude grades, scores, and evaluative feedback</li>
<li>Contain submissions shared as learning examples, not model solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>The repository reflects open source learning practices by allowing students to observe multiple implementations, coding styles, and design approaches.</p>
<h3>Expectations for Use of Shared Work</h3>
<p>Consistent with both academic integrity standards and open source ethics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students may review peer submissions to improve understanding</li>
<li>Students may not copy, reuse, adapt, or submit repository code for any assignment as their own work</li>
<li>Students must submit work they can confidently explain without reliance on others’ solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>The ability to explain one’s own work is a core expectation of this course and a key professional skill in software development.</p>

<h3>Professional Conduct and Integrity</h3>
<p>Students are expected to engage with shared materials respectfully and professionally. The goal of transparency is learning, not comparison or judgment of peers.</p>
<p>Concerns identified through personal reviews or misuse of repository materials will be handled in accordance with departmental and institutional academic integrity procedures.</p>
