    <section>
<p>In our increasingly online world, writing may be the only means of communication you have with classmates, colleagues, associates, instructors, and others. Learning to do this effectively will enhance your personal brand and position you to succeed both personally and professionally.  Follow the guidelines below to portray yourself as knowledgeable, respectful, and polite in all forms of interaction whether it be online discussions, email, or other forms of communications.</p>
<h3>Email Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Subject – must include course and section number</li>
<li>Very brief greeting</li>
<li>Concise description of the problem, question, or reason for emailing</li>
<li>Screenshot or screen recording if there is a technical problem</li>
<li>Entire name in signature (not just first)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Be Scholarly</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do: Use proper language, grammar, and spelling. Be explanatory and justify your opinions. Credit the ideas of others through citing and linking to scholarly resources.</li>
<li>Avoid: Misinforming others when you may not know the answer. If you are guessing about something, clearly state that you do not know the answer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Be Respectful</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do: Respect privacy, diversity, and opinions of others. Communicate tactfully and base disagreements on scholarly ideas or research evidence.</li>
<li>Avoid: Sharing another person's professional or personal information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Be Professional</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do: Always represent yourself well. Be truthful, accurate and run a final spell check. Limit the use of slang and emoticons.</li>
<li>Avoid: Using profanity or participating in hostile interactions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Be Polite</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do: Address others by name or appropriate title and be mindful of your tone. Treat people as if you were in a face-to-face situation.</li>
<li>Avoid: Using sarcasm, being rude or writing in all capital letters. Written words can be easily misinterpreted as they lack nonverbals.</li>
</ul>
